# INI_Backup
With the push of a button you can backup all INI configurations from a given directory or restore them. 
This can be helpful if you have uninstalled a program or you have verified game cache from Steam and have lost some (or all) configuration files. 

Simply configure the target program & backup its configurations with this simple tool!

### All backups will be created in a folder called "Replace" located in the same directory as the program itself.
